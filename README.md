# OpenCorrï¼š An open source C++ library for digital image correlation 

OpenCorr is an open source C++ library for research and development of 2D, 3D/stereo, and volumetric digital image correlation (DIC). It provides a developer-friendly, lightweight, and efficient kit to the users who are willing to study the state-of-the-art algorithms of DIC and DVC (digital volume correlation), or to create DIC and DVC programs for their specific applications. OpenCorr GUI is a shareware with graphical user interface developed based on OpenCorr, demonstrating main functions of this library.
